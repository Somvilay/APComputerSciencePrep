A5. if loops
3
Which of the following if statement headers uses the correct syntax?
A0. if (x == y) {
A1. if [x == 10] {
A2. if (x equals 42) {
A3. if (x => y) {
A4. if x = 10 then {
0
The expression (0.2 + 1.2 + 2.2 + 3.2) should equal 6.8, but in Java it does not. Why not?
A0. Those numbers are integers in Java, so the sum is 6.
A1. Java is unable to perform a + expression involving so many numbers, so the code does not compile.
A2. Java has a bug making it unable to add real numbers accurately, unlike other superior languages such as C++.
A3. Real numbers are represented as imprecise floating-point numbers in the computer, and the limited precision led to a roundoff error.
A4. Those numbers are integers in Java, so the sum The programmer forgot to cast the expression to type double, so the result is inaccurate.is 6.

Consider a method getGrade that accepts an integer representing a student's grade percentage in a course and returns that student's numerical course grade:
    public static double getGrade(int percentage) {
     ...
    }
The grade can be between 0.0 (failing) and 4.0 (perfect).
Which of the following are precondition(s) that are appropriate for this method?
A0. The parameter's value must be greater than or equal to 100.
A1. The parameter's value must be greater than or equal to 0.
A2. The parameter must be a letter grade of 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'.
A3. The parameter can be an integer or a real number.
A4. The parameter's value must be between 0.0 and 4.0.
