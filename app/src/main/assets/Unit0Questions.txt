Why do computers use binary numbers?
A0. At the time when computers were invented, humans only knew about the numbers 0 and 1.
A1. It is easier to build electronic devices reliably if they only have to distinguish between two electric states.
A2. It makes the computer faster and more efficient than other number bases.
A3. It is impossible to build a computer that uses a different number base than binary.
A4. Because there are 10 types of people: Those who understand binary, and those who don't.

What is the difference between the file MyProgram.java and the file MyProgram.class?
A0. The programmer writes the .class file first, and the .java file is generated automatically later.
A1. A java file contains code written in the Java language, and a .class file contains code written in the C++ language.
A2. A java file is a much larger binary file and a .class file is a smaller compressed version.
A3. The class file is for object-oriented programming and the .java file is for procedural programming.
A4. MyProgram.java is a source code file typed by the programmer, and MyProgram.class is a compiled executable class file that is run by the computer.

Which of the following is the correct syntax to output a message?
A0. System.println.out('Hello, world!');
A1. System.println("Hello, world!");
A2. Out.system.println"(Hello, world!)";
A3. System.out.println("Hello, world!");
A4. System.println(Hello, world!);

Which of the following method headers uses the correct syntax?
A0. public static void example() {
A1. public void static example{} (
A2. public void static example() {
